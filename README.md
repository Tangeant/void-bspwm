# Vision

This github will not only install the desktop, but it will install all needed software for a new BSPWM install.

We will also make it very easy to have a desktop you can be proud of.
All icons, themes, cursors, wallpapers, conky's  will be there.
Just select them.

Change the scripts to give it a personal touch.
Hashtag out the applications you do not want.

Copy/paste lines and add applications you do want.

And then run the scripts.

Learn, have fun and enjoy.
